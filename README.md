### Realtime facial recognition sentiment analysis 

This is a realtime facial recognition sentiment analysis using OpenCV and
[indico](https://indico.io). It determines the emotions (anger, fear, happiness,
neutral, sadness, surprise) expressed in an image of a human face in the video.
It works using the built-in webcam of a laptop.

This proof-of-concept was the winner of the Computational Neuropsychiatry track
at the 2018 [Princeton Medihack](https://princetonmedihack.io/).

Many thanks to our team Alice Yoon (@misun6312), Paulo Serodio, and Harris
Paspuleti.
